# A new blog
:hp-tags: blog

So this works!

This blog runs on GitHub pages using the awesome repo HubPress.footnote:[https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io]. I (Steven van Loef) will be writing about the things I work on. As a freelance PHP and JavaScript developer I tend to write a lot of code :) I have developed in other languages as well, like C, ObjectiveC, Cobol, Basic, Pascal, Z80 assembly.footnote:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80]. But these days I mostly code in PHP and JavaScript and some ObjectiveC to extend Appcelerator.

On this blog I hope to share some of my code (snippets) and other technical write ups that can be useful to others. The http://blog.vanloef.com/2015/02/10/Nimbuslabel-module-for-Appcelerator.html[first article] after this one will be about an iOS module I wrote for the Appcelerator.footnote:[http://www.appcelerator.com] platform. I use Appcelerator for creating iOS apps. Most code is written in JavaScript, but the end result is a native iOS app (or Android and other mobile platforms). You can also expect me to write about the CakePHP.footnote:[http://cakephp.org] framework. I have been using CakePHP since 2006 and still use it for most projects.

I hope you enjoy what you read here and find it useful.
